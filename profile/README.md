## What We Build

Sylphx is an AI-native platform for developers who want to ship without managing infrastructure. Install the SDK, connect GitHub, push code — everything else is handled.

```bash
npm install @sylphx/sdk
```

One key. Everything works.

## The Platform

19 production-ready services, fully unified:

| Category | Services |
|----------|---------|
| **Build** | AI Gateway (200+ models), Database, Storage, Jobs, KV, Realtime |
| **Users** | Auth, Email, Push, Consent |
| **Grow** | Analytics, Feature Flags, Referrals, Engagement, Search |
| **Operate** | Monitoring, Webhooks, Billing, Deploy |

No Vercel dashboard. No Supabase project. No Clerk account. One `SYLPHX_SECRET_KEY`.

Deploy is built in — Git push to production, zero config. Apps run at `{app}.sylphx.app`.

---

## We Run It All On Our Own Platform

We don't just build Sylphx. We run on it.

**[Anima](https://anima.sylphx.com)** — our AI agent infrastructure system — is built entirely on the Sylphx Platform. It runs persistent AI teams with Docker-isolated agents, 4-stage semantic memory, and zero credential leakage. Every one of our production products is a customer of our own platform.

**Customer Zero.** If it can run Anima, it can run your product.
